subtitle: "Evolution of Gene Regulation and Variation at Duke University's Genetics and Genomics Program"
description: "Thanks for stopping by - I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at Duke University, working with Dr. Greg Wray in the University Program in Genetics and Genomics. I'm passionate about explaining the origin and maintenance of diversity in the natural world, using an ever-changing toolkit of genetic and epigenetic tools. To do this well, I am becoming increasingly interested in how we wrangle and visualize big datasets, and am particularly excited about how graphic and design choices can help us communicate genetics more effectively, to other academics as well as the public."
